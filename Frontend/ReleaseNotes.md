| Each merge into main should increment the second number of the version, ie. the version after this should be 1.1, the one after that 1.2, after 1.9 the order is 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, etc. If there is a MAJOR release, to be determined by the team, then the initial digit can be incremented. Each merge should also detail what features are being added, in this box. |
