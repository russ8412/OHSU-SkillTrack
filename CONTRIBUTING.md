# Contributing Guide

How to set up, code, test, review, and release.

## Code of Conduct
IMPORT THIS FROM THE TEAM CHARTER - Currently a WIP

## Getting Started
Please review the README.md file for how to prepare your environment to run the app. 

## Branching & Workflow
The default branch is **main**, this branch should **never** be written to directly. 

When making contributions, always create a **new branch** or contribute to an **existing feature branch** instead.

If multiple contributors are working together on a set of related or complex features (for example, when the front-end team is implementing several features that are best released together), they should use a **release branch** workflow.
All contributors to that bundle should merge their changes into a release branch. Once the release branch is complete, stable, and ready, a pull request (PR) should be opened to merge it into main.

## Issues & Planning

Explain how to file issues, required templates/labels, estimation, and triage/assignment practices.

## Commit Messages

State the convention (e.g., Conventional Commits), include examples, and how to reference issues.

## Code Style, Linting & Formatting

Name the formatter/linter, config file locations, and the exact commands to check/fix locally.

## Testing

Define required test types, how to run tests, expected coverage thresholds, and when new/updated tests are mandatory.

## Pull Requests & Reviews

Outline PR requirements (template, checklist, size limits), reviewer expectations, approval rules, and required status checks.

## CI/CD

Link to pipeline definitions, list mandatory jobs, how to view logs/re-run jobs, and what must pass before merge/release.

## Security & Secrets

State how to report vulnerabilities, prohibited patterns (hard-coded secrets), dependency update policy, and scanning tools.

## Documentation Expectations

Specify what must be updated (README, docs/, API refs, CHANGELOG) and docstring/comment standards.

## Release Process

Describe versioning scheme, tagging, changelog generation, packaging/publishing steps, and rollback process.

## Support & Contact

Provide maintainer contact channel, expected response windows, and where to ask questions.
